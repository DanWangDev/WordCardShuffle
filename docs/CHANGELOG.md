### Phase 7a — Enhanced Learning & Exam Prep (PR #24)

Sentence building result persistence, spelling exercises (definition + fill-in-the-blank modes), PvP question persistence with rematch support, timed challenge mode (exam simulation), and 7 new achievements (22 total).

**New features:**
- **Spelling exercises** — two modes: definition prompt (type the word from its definition) and fill-in-the-blank (type the missing word in a sentence); forced retry on mistakes for muscle memory reinforcement
- **Timed challenge mode** — exam simulation with per-question countdown at 3 difficulty levels (easy 15s, medium 10s, hard 6s); auto-advance on timeout
- **PvP question persistence** — questions now stored at challenge creation for fairness; rematch button; per-question comparison view
- **Exercise result tracking** — sentence building and spelling results now persist to `exercise_results`/`exercise_answers` tables, feed into word mastery and achievements

**Schema changes (migrations 021–023):**
- `exercise_results` + `exercise_answers` tables for persisting exercise session data
- `pvp_questions` table for storing challenge questions at creation time
- `pvp_challenges.rematch_of` column for rematch tracking
- `quiz_results` CHECK constraint updated to include `'timed'` quiz type
- 7 new achievements: `pvp_wins_5`, `pvp_wins_10`, `pvp_streak_3`, `spelling_20`, `perfect_speller`, `speed_round`, `time_master`

**Key commits:**
- `7d1e828` feat: Phase 7a enhanced learning — exercises, spelling, PvP persistence, timed mode
